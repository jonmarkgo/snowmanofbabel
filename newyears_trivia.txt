1907 - New York's famous ball drops for the first time from Times Square on New Year's Eve. It was a five foot ball made out of wood and iron, weighed 700 lbs, and included 100 25-watt bulbs.
Today, the Times Square ball is a 6-foot globe made out of Waterford crystal and weighs 1,070 lbs. It contains 9,576 LEDs (light emitting diodes) and uses relatively little energy (as much as about 10 toasters).
The Times Square ball has been dropped every year, except in 1942 and 1943 due to wartime lighting restrictions.
